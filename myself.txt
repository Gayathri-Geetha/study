My name is Gayathri,i have completed my bachelors degree in electronics and comm.eng. during my engineering i had few modules from computer science deptcoding side from my engeneering time,and that intrest helped me land a job in my most recent role as a software developer at ust .Where i worked in a us based project in the health care domain.During my time in Ust i got to work with several technologies like in java,J2EE, spring boot, microservices,relational data base, rest Apiaâ€™s cloud, oracle database ,several devops tools like git maven,jenkins,Docker.also cloud services like Ec2 ,S3 etc.

we have several modules in the project and i have worked in few modules,my recent module for which i have worked was  the health condition module where we handle particular health conditions i was handling the pregnancy health condition in that module where we determine the eligibility of the  enrolled member for the particular health condition, enabling new policy for pregnancy or terminate the existing one and initiate a new policy for the existing member. We used 2 microservices to achieve this.my project was following agile methodologies and i was responsible for below activities in my project i participate in the backlog grooming sessions to undesrstand  the pending items and also i get the functional document from our project functional team located at client location. I go through the requirement, understant the requirement and if any queries i have related to the functionalities, i will set up meeting with my functional team along with ba,and get the clarifications. Once all the rquirements are clarified i will work on the design part of my project.once the developement is completed iw ill perform unit testing to see if the code is working perfectly and once unit testing is done then perform code review to identify any mistakes in the code with senior developer. once this is done i will integrate this code in the git repository.once the code is integrated i will execute the pipelines created by our devops team to build and deploy the code to the dev region. once the deployement is completed without any issue i will infrom the sit team regarding the completion of the developement. 
In a typical work day i spend 70% of my time coding and remaining 30% in analysisng requiements, attending meetings, having team discussions.
